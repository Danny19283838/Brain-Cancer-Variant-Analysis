**Brain Cancer Variant Analysis:**
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and pattern discovery on a dataset of 8,500+ genomic variants related to brain cancer. The goal is to clean the variant dataset, extract meaningful features (reference and alternate alleles, positions, mutation types), and visualize key distributions to support downstream bioinformatics pipelines.


**Skills Demonstrated**
- Python data analysis
- Genomic data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Variant-level feature extraction
- Pattern visualization
- Bioinformatics research workflows



**Key Analyses**
- Distribution of genomic positions
- Frequency of reference vs. alternate alleles
- Mutation type patterns (e.g., A>T, C>G)
- Variant density across chromosomal regions
- Summary statistics of variant annotations
